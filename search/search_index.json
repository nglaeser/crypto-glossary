Knowledge assumption ... These types of assumptions are non-falsifiable. (Non-)Falsifiable A falsifiable assumption is an assumption where a challenger can efficiently decide whether the adversary won the game (i.e., broke the assumption). Many standard assumptions are falsifiable (discrete log, DDH, CDH, RSA, factoring, LWE, SIS, SVP, LPN, one-way functions). Knowledge assumptions, on the other hand, are an example of a class of non-falsifiable assumptions. See also discussion in Gentry-Wichs.

The advantage is generally defined with respect to a security game. For secure constructions, the adversary's advantage usually shown to be small by showing it is bounded by a negligible function. Adversary Some dishonest entity that will try to break a primitive or protocol. See Threat Models for the types of adversaries, each with different capabilities. Bijective A function which is both injective and surjective, that is, every element in the codomain has exactly one preimage in the domain. This implies that the domain and codomain have equal cardinalities (any element of the domain that doesn't map to anything is, by definition, not included in the domain).  Black-box Treating some algorithm or protocol as a \"black box\" that hides the inner mechanism, allowing only the inputs and outputs to be seen. For instance, black-box constructions are constructions that use some building block as a black box without caring about its inner workings (only its generic input-output behavior). Correctness A property of a scheme that ensures it works correctly and does not trivially meet the definition of the scheme. For example, we usually require that decryption and encryption are inverses, or that sharing and reconstruction are inverses. Cryptographic Primitives Basic building blocks for cryptographic protocols. Deterministic A function that always proceeds in the same way when run on the same outputs. Alternatively, the inputs directly determine the output. Compare to randomized. Feasibility result Field A set of elements F with two binary operations + and \u2022 (addition and multiplication) that satisfy a set of properties called the field axioms (specifically associativity, commutativity, identity, and invertibility of both operations along with distributivity of multiplication over addition). Both the rational numbers and the real numbers are fields. Functionality A particular set of capabilities or properties to be achieved. For example, many protocols exist that implement the functionality of public key encryption. In this way, a functionality is abstract and independent of implementation details, and cryptosystems are build to achieve a functionality. Often, to prove security, a protocol is compared to an ideal functionality, to show that it meets the same security properties. Function A mathematical object that maps each input to at most one output.  Group A set of elements \\(G\\) with some binary operation \u2022 (the group operation) that satisfies a set of properties called the group axioms (specifically associativity, identity, and invertibility). The integers form a group under addition. Hardness assumption A problem, such as factoring, which is assumed to be hard. A cryptographic scheme's security may hinge on the adversary not being able to solve this problem, and if the assumption turns out not to hold, the proof of security is invalidated. See Assumptions for more details. Independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Two random variables are i.i.d. if they have the same probability distribution and are independent of each other. Indistinguishable <p>Indistinguishability refers to how hard two probability distributions are to tell apart.  </p> Perfectly indistinguishable Two distributions are perfectly indistinguishable if they are identical: they are the same distribution. Statistically indistinguishable Two distributions are statistically indistinguishable if they are statistically \"close\", ...  Computationally indistinguishable Two distributions are computationally indistinguishable if distinguishing them would require solving some computationally intractable problem. Injective A function such that every element of the codomain is the image of at most one element of the domain. Equivalently, \\(f(a)=f(b)\\) implies \\(a=b\\).Also known as one-to-one. Compare to surjective, bijective.  Linear operations Addition and scalar multiplication. Min-entropy Negligible function A function that asymptotically (i.e. after some fixed point) decreases faster than any inverse polynomial: <p>Formal Definition</p> <p>A function \\(f\\) is negligible if for all natural numbers c, there exists a natural number \\(N\\) such that \\(f(n) &lt; n^{-c}\\) for all \\(n &gt; N\\).</p> Norm <p>A function from a vector space to non-negative (real) numbers. In cryptography, we mostly deal with integers, so norms usually map an integer vector to a single non-negative integer. A norm can be thought of as a sort of distance measure because it must meet the following three properties:  </p> <ol> <li>Triangle inequality, i.e., \\(\\mathsf{norm}(\\vec{x} + \\vec{y}) \\leq \\mathsf{norm}(\\vec{x}) + \\mathsf{norm}(\\vec{y})\\) </li> <li>Linearity up to absolute value (absolute homogeneity), i.e., \\(\\mathsf{norm}(s\\vec{x}) = \\lvert s \\rvert \\mathsf{norm}(\\vec{x})\\) for any scalar \\(s\\)</li> <li>Zero only at the origin, i.e., \\(\\mathsf{norm}(\\vec{x}) = 0\\) iff \\(\\vec{x} = \\vec{0}\\)</li> </ol> <p>Some common norms applied to a vector \\(\\vec{x} = (x_1, \\dots, x_\\ell)\\) are:</p> <ul> <li>Infinity norm: \\(\\lVert \\vec{x} \\rVert_\\infty = \\max(\\lvert x_i \\rvert)\\)</li> <li>Euclidean norm (aka L2 norm): \\(\\lVert \\vec{x} \\rVert_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_i x_i^2}\\)</li> <li>L1 norm: \\(\\lVert \\vec{x} \\rVert_1 = \\sum_i \\lvert x_i \\rvert\\)</li> </ul> <p>These are special cases of the Lp norm \\(\\lVert \\vec{x} \\rVert_p = (\\sum_i \\lvert x_i \\rvert^p)^{1/p}\\).</p> Parameterized Probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) A potentially probabilistic algorithm that runs in polynomially many steps. In cryptography, we usually consider PPT adversaries (polynomial in the security parameter). Protocol A sequence of messages exchanged between parties to compute some functionality. A protocol specifies how parties should compute their messages based on their knowledge and the other parties' responses. Often denoted by the variable \\(\\Pi\\). Probabilistic Randomized A function whose output is influenced by some additional source of randomness. Running the function twice on the same inputs may result in a different outcome. Compare to deterministic. Ring Security game A game is a challenge in which an attacker (called the adversary and usually denoted by a curly letter \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)) is given some information and tries to break the security property of the scheme. \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) \"wins\" the game if it can give an answer that proves it broke the security property of the scheme. For an example, see the CPA-security game. See also Game-based proofs. A security game is sometimes also called an experiment. Security parameter Denoted by \\(\\lambda\\) (or sometimes \\(\\kappa\\)), this is a measure of how hard it is to break the security of a system.  Generally, an adversary's advantage in attacking a scheme should be negligible in the security parameter; thus, the parameter needs to be large enough that the specific negligible function also corresponds to a sufficiently low success probability in practice. Computational security parameters are generally \\(\\lambda = 128\\) or \\(\\lambda = 256\\) and correspond to the size of the instance of the computational problem to be solved; information-theoretic security parameters can be lower and correspond directly to an adversary's statistical success probability. (See also the Wikipedia page.) Surjective A function such that every element of the codomain has at least one preimage in the domain. Also known as onto. Compare to injective, bijective.  Sybil attack Attack in which an adversary creates multiple fake identities (parties) it controls in order to increase its influence in a network. To an outside observer these machines can't be distinguished from other honest parties/identities. One way to prevent this is asking new users to perform a somewhat costly registration process as a way to rate-limit creating new identities. Uniform A distribution is uniform, or a value uniformly distributed, if every outcome is equally likely. We may say that a value is \"drawn uniformly at random\". A uniform distribution over \\(N\\) elements means each of the elements is drawn with probability \\(1/N\\). Unary Compared to binary, which represents numbers using two symbols (0 and 1), the unary representation of a number consists only of 1s. Specifically, a number \\(n\\) is represented in unary as a string of \\(n\\) 1s (e.g., 5 in unary would be 11111). Security parameters are usually given as an input in their unary representation, i.e. \\(1^\\lambda\\). \"Without loss of generality\" This means that only one particular case is analyzed, but the argument holds equally in the other cases."},{"location":"general/#complexity-theory","title":"Complexity Theory","text":"Big-O notation Written \\(O(g(n))\\) for some function \\(g\\), this is an upper bound on the computational complexity of an algorithm/protocol/etc. when \\(n\\) is large enough (i.e., an asymptotic bound).

This is also called full security. Computational security The security of the scheme can be reduced to solving some problem that is assumed to be computationally hard, i.e. its security rests on a computational assumption. Covert security Forward secrecy In key agreement protocols, this is the guarantee that the compromise of long-term secrets in some session \\(t\\) does not affect the security of any sessions that took place before \\(t\\) (i.e., those messages still cannot be decrypted).

The adversary also has access to an oracle for the group function. (This is like how, in the random oracle model, we give the adversary access to a random oracle instead of a real hash function used in practice.) Quantum Random Oracle Model (QROM) An analogue of the ROM for quantum adversaries. Random Oracle Model (ROM) A proof paradigm that models hash functions as random oracles, i.e. an oracle that outputs a random number for any input (but outputs the same number when given the same input). Read more here. Variants include the programmable ROM and others. Standard Model This model assumes only that the adversary is limited by time or computational power; it makes no further assumptions (the way, e.g., the ROM does). Proofs in the standard model therefore usually rest on a computational hardness assumption, but no idealized cryptographic primitives, and are thus very difficult. In this way this model is \"better\" than the others listed here because it assumes less.

A language is some set of elements that meet a particular property. For instance, the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{HAM}\\) is the set of graphs which contain a Hamiltonian cycle. A less mathy example might be the set of words which have double-letters (\"hello\" is in this language because it contains two back-to-back L's, but \"world\" is not).</p> <p>Loosely defined, a language is in NP if it is difficult to decide whether an element belongs to a language, but easy to confirm that it is when provided some evidence (called a witness). In the case of \\(\\mathcal{L}_{HAM}\\), it's difficult to check if a graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle because finding such a cycle is hard. But if you are given a graph and a supposed cycle in the graph, it's easy to check that the graph really does contain that cycle. </p> <p>In the case of our less abstract example, think of a computer program that determes whether a word is in the double-letter language: we have to check all the pairs of consecutive letters in the word and see if any of them match. If we are told exactly which two letters repeat and where they are in the word (that is, given the witness <code>ll, 2</code> for the word \"hello\"), we can quickly jump to the letter at index <code>2</code> in the word and only check that the next two letters both equal <code>l</code>. (This is not a perfect example, since cycling through the entire length of the word doesn't take all that much time, but the point is that the witness simplifies the verification process.)</p>"},{"location":"Areas-of-Cryptography/zk/#zk_1","title":"ZK","text":"<p>Zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols occur between two parties: a prover and a verifier.

Soundness Intuitively, a cheating (malicious) prover \\(P^*\\) cannot (except with negligible probability) provide a valid proof of a false statement.  <ul> <li> Knowledge Soundness This property is stronger than soundness. Intuitively, it says that any valid proof has a corresponding witness. Formally, for any valid proof, there exists an extractor which can extract the witness when given the proof. What does this actually mean? It says that if a prover provides a valid proof, it must have known the witness. In other words, a cheating prover cannot provide a proof of even a true statement if it does not know the witness. </li> <li> Special Soundness This lies between soundness and knowledge soundness (?) and applies only to interactive proof systems. Given two (or \\(s\\), in the case of \\(s\\)-special soundness) valid transcripts for the same statement and with the same first message, there exists an efficient extractor which can recover the witness corresponding to the statement. The \"special\" part means that this property implies soundness. </li> <li> Simulation Soundness This property requires that soundness holds even when \\(P^*\\) has seen many simulated proofs (potentially even for false statements), i.e. \\(P^*\\) is additionally given an arbitrary number of statement-proof pairs \\((x,\\pi)\\) such that \\(V(x,\\pi)=1\\). </li> <li> Simulation Extractability aka simulation-knowledge soundness. A combination of knowledge soundness and simulation soundness, this notion says that knowledge soundness holds even when given access to arbitrarily many simulated proofs. This notion was formulated to capture the notion of non-malleability (which it implies), since knowledge soundness on its own says nothing about the capabilities of a prover that has seen a valid proof to produce a new valid proof by \"mauling\" the honest proof (malleability).

Blind signatures <p>Blind Schnorr signatures</p> Designated-verifier (DV) signatures Instead of being publicly verifiable, a signature can only be verified by a specific party (the DV). Message authentication codes (MACs) can be thought of as DV-sigs, since a secret key is necessary to verify a MAC, so only parties that know the secret key can perform verification. Group signatures One person in a group can produce a signature on behalf of everyone in the group. The signature does not reveal which member of the group produced it, so the signer benefits from some k-anonymity. Unlike ring signatures, there is also a special party called the group manager who is able to determine the signer given the signature. Multi-signatures A set of arbitrary size \\(\\ell\\) can work together to produce a single signature on a shared message. Unlike threshold signatures, the (minimum) number of signers is not fixed upfront and can vary; furthermore, the identities of the signers are not hidden, and in fact a goal of the scheme is to be able to prove that everyone in the stated group of signers agreed to produce the signatures.  Compare to threshold signatures (see also the discussion on page 34 of [Bol03]). Ring signatures Like group signatures, a member of the \"ring\" (group) can produce a signature on behalf of everyone in the group while remaining anonymous. Compare to group signatures. Threshold signatures signing/secret key is split into secret shares; producing a signature requires some threshold number of shares. A threshold signature should be indistinguishable from an ordinary signature.
