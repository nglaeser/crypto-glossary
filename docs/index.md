# How to Use This Glossary

For the most part, I use a standard glossary style, that is,

> **Term**
> : This is the definition of the term. I might bold **other terms** being defined inside the definition.

I use the following callouts for specific examples, summaries, etc.:

!!! example "Example/Construction"
    Examples or specific constructions that realize some cryptographic primitive.

!!! note "Notation"
    For comments about notation.

!!! summary
    Duh.

!!! info
    Usually include some formal definition or theorem.

!!! tip "Further Reading"
    Pointers to some additional material.

!!! warning
    Draw attention to some small but significant detail.
