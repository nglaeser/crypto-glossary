## Commitment schemes

A commitment scheme consists of a commitment algorithm $\sf Com$ and an opening (decommitment) algorithm $\sf Open$. 
- ${\sf Com}(m) \rightarrow ({\sf com}, {\sf decom})$: Commit to a message $m$ with the commitment $\sf com$; also output decommitment information $\sf decom$.
- ${\sf Open}({\sf com}, {\sf decom}) \rightarrow m$: Open the commitment.

Properties:

- **Hiding:** Seeing $\sf com$ should reveal no information about $m$.

- **Binding:** It should be infeasible to open $\sf com$ to a different message $m' \neq m$ (i.e., find some other decommitment information ${\sf decom}' \neq {\sf decom}$ so that ${\sf Open}({\sf com}, {\sf decom}') \neq m$).
 
!!! example "Pedersen commitments"

    === "Scheme"
        Given a group $\mathbb{G}$ of prime order $q$ and $g,h$ elements (generators) of $\mathbb{G}$:

        - $\underline{{\sf Com}(m)}:$ output ${\sf com} = g^m h^r$ where $r \gets^\$ \mathbb{Z}_q$; set ${\sf decom} = (m,r)$.
        - $\underline{{\sf Open}({\sf com}, {\sf decom})}:$ directly outputs ${\sf decom} = (m,r)$. The verifier can check that ${\sf com} = g^m h^r$.

    === "Properties"
        - unconditional hiding
        - computational binding (by DLog assumption)

**Polynomial commitment**
: Allows one to commit to a polynomial $f(x)$ and later open it at individual points, e.g. reveal $f(a)$.

!!! example "Kate/KZG polynomial commitment"

    === "Scheme"
        Let $\mathbb{G}$ be an elliptic curve group of prime order $p$ with generator $G$ (additive notation) and $d$ be the degree of the polynomial to commit to. $e: \mathbb{G} \times \mathbb{G} \mapsto $\mathbb{G}_T$ is a pairing.

        - $\underline{{\sf Setup}}$: output ${\sf crs} = \{G, aG, a^2 G, \dots, a^d G\}$ for a uniform $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p$.
        - $\underline{{\sf Com}({\sf crs}, f(x))}$: the commitment to the polynomial $f(x) = f_0 + f_1 x + \dots + f_d x^d$ is $f(a) \cdot G$, which can be computed from the $\sf crs$ as 

            $$C_f = f_0 {\sf crs}[0] + f_1 {\sf crs}[1] + \dots + f_d {\sf crs}[d]$$

            $$= f_0 G + f_1 a G + \dots f_d a^d G = f(a) \cdot G.$$

        - $\underline{{\sf EvalProof}({\sf crs}, C_f, b, c)}$: to prove that the commitment $C_f$ to $f$ opens to $c$ at $b$, i.e. that $f(b) = c$, send $C_q \gets {\sf Com}({\sf crs}, q(x))$, where 

            $$ q(x) = \frac{f(x) - f(b)}{x - b} = \frac{f(x) - c}{x - b} $$
        
            (this is a polynomial by [Little BÃ©zout's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_remainder_theorem)). The verifier checks that $e(C_q, aG - bG) = e(C_f - cG, G)$ holds.

    === "Properties"
        - The prover can do a "full open" and reveal the full polynomial by simply sending a candidate polynomial $f'$; the verifier checks that ${\sf Com}({\sf crs}, f'(x)) = C_f$. There is an [optimization [Feist-Khovratovich]](https://alinush.github.io/2021/06/17/Feist-Khovratovich-technique-for-computing-KZG-proofs-fast.html) that allows one to do this in $d\log{d}$ time instead of $d^2$.
        - There is also a "batch mode" in which the prover can open $t < d$ points, which the verifier can check with a single pairing. See "further reading".
        - **Trusted setup**: the scheme relies on a trusted setup, i.e. a well-formed CRS. (On the plus side, the CRS is of the "power-of-tau" variant, which is fairly easy to generate via an [MPC](../Areas-of-Cryptography/mpc.md) protocol (e.g., [2022/1592](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1592)).)

**Shrinking commitment**
: <!-- used when we want the pk to be small? -->

**Vector commitment**
: A vector commitment allows one to commit to a vector $\vec{v} = (v_1, \dots, v_n)$ and later individually open elements $v_i$.

**One-way function (OWF)**
: In a way this is also [an assumption](../assumptions.md#other), since we don't know of any function that is provably hard to invert.

**Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE)**

**Pseudo-random function (PRF)**
: A function that maps inputs to outputs so that the outputs appear randomly distributed. The function is deterministic in the sense that querying it on the same input always returns the same (random-looking) output.

    !!! example "Construction: PRF from PRG [GGM]"
        Given a length-doubling PRG $G: \{0, 1\}^\lambda \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{2\lambda}$, we can construct a PRF $F: \{0, 1\}^\lambda \times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^\lambda$ which takes a $\lambda$-bit key $k$ and $n$-bit input $x$ and outputs a pseudorandom $\lambda$-bit value. The construction is described in [this note](../assets/notes/PRF-from-PRG.png). The idea is to construct a height-$n$ tree of calls to $G$ using $k$ as the root. The output of $F(k,x)$ is determined by following the path given by the bits of $x$.

        Moreover, this construction is in fact a *puncturable* PRF: we can puncture out points by removing the PRG seeds in the tree along the path to that point.
