# Post-quantum cryptography (PQC)

!!! summary
    Cryptographic primitives that are secure against adversaries with quantum capabilities. Not to be confused with [_quantum_ cryptography](./other.md#quantum-crypto), where the _users_ of the cryptography must have quantum capabilities; in PQC, the protocol itself can still use classical computers, it's just secure against a broader class of adversaries (quantum in addition to classical adversaries).
